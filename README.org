#+title: A Sound Encoding of Symbolic State into SMT-LIB

This repository contains Haskell examples of both OX and UX
sound encoding strategies for checking the satisfiability of symbolic states through SMT solvers.

This example is designed to accompany my [[https://github.com/shiva-tk/masters-thesis-report][Master's Thesis]].
